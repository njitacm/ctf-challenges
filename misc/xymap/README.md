## Solution
Check the UV Map of the .fbx file

```
a 3d model where the UV map (the mapping for textures onto the polygons) contains the flag

there is no texture assigned to the model, but it isn't needed to find the flag. assigning one may help reveal the UVs, however

without any 3d modeling experience this becomes an out of the box steg problem

the model is from a freely available blender splash screen. https://cloud.blender.org/p/gallery/60337d495677e942564cce76

flag: jctf{gETfLooR}
```

## Challenge Message 
Dinosaurs are rampaging through the city and only you can stop them. You managed to get a model of them and find out they are powered by the sun, what could you possibly do with that information? 

## Challenge Hints
* Trying to get the W, but it flipped. Alphabet be like that tho!
