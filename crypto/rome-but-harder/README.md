## Challenge Message
The previous rome challenge must have been too easy, so Ro-Man sent you another. A note with an even more cryptic message, the number 46 and a mirror. What could you possibly do with that? 

## Challenge Hint
* This may have given the emperor of Rome sound headaches, I can only pace forward and reverse, and probably have done it for at least 64 times.
* Old time crypto with a modern spin!
